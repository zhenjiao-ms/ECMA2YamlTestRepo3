## Remarks  
 The garbage collector is a common language runtime component that controls the allocation and release of managed memory. The methods in this class influence when garbage collection is performed on an object and when resources allocated by an object are released. Properties in this class provide information about the total amount of memory available in the system and the age category, or generation, of memory allocated to an object.  
  
 The garbage collector tracks and reclaims objects allocated in managed memory. Periodically, the garbage collector performs garbage collection to reclaim memory allocated to objects for which there are no valid references. Garbage collection happens automatically when a request for memory cannot be satisfied using available free memory. Alternatively, an application can force garbage collection using the <xref:System.GC.Collect%2A> method.  
  
 Garbage collection consists of the following steps:  
  
1.  The garbage collector searches for managed objects that are referenced in managed code.  
  
2.  The garbage collector tries to finalize objects that are not referenced.  
  
3.  The garbage collector frees objects that are not referenced and reclaims their memory.

<a name="unmanaged"></a>   
## The garbage collector and unmanaged resources  
 During a collection, the garbage collector will not free an object if it finds one or more references to the object in managed code. However, the garbage collector does not recognize references to an object from unmanaged code, and might free objects that are being used exclusively in unmanaged code unless explicitly prevented from doing so. The <xref:System.GC.KeepAlive%2A> method provides a mechanism that prevents the garbage collector from collecting objects that are still in use in unmanaged code.  
  
 Aside from managed memory allocations, implementations of the garbage collector do not maintain information about resources held by an object, such as file handles or database connections. When a type uses unmanaged resources that must be released before instances of the type are reclaimed, the type can implement a finalizer.  
  
 In most cases, finalizers are implemented by overriding the <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method; however, types written in C# or C++ implement destructors, which compilers turn into an override of <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. In most cases, if an object has a finalizer, the garbage collector calls it prior to freeing the object. However, the garbage collector is not required to call finalizers in all situations; for example, the <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A> method explicitly prevents an object's finalizer from being called. Also, the garbage collector is not required to use a specific thread to finalize objects, or guarantee the order in which finalizers are called for objects that reference each other but are otherwise available for garbage collection.  
  
 In scenarios where resources must be released at a specific time, classes can implement the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface, which contains the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method that performs resource management and cleanup tasks. Classes that implement <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> must specify, as part of their class contract, if and when class consumers call the method to clean up the object. The garbage collector does not, by default, call the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method; however, implementations of the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method can call methods in the GC class to customize the finalization behavior of the garbage collector.  
  
 For more information on object finalization and the dispose pattern, see [Cleaning Up Unmanaged Resources](../Topic/Cleaning%20Up%20Unmanaged%20Resources.md).  
  
<a name="generations"></a>   
## Object aging and generations  
 The garbage collector in the common language runtime supports object aging using generations. A generation is a unit of measure of the relative age of objects in memory. The generation number, or age, of an object indicates the generation to which an object belongs. Objects created more recently are part of newer generations, and have lower generation numbers than objects created earlier in the application life cycle. Objects in the most recent generation are in generation 0. This implementation of the garbage collector supports three generations of objects, generations 0, 1, and 2. You can retrieve the value of the <xref:System.GC.MaxGeneration%2A> property to determine the maximum generation number supported by the system.  
  
 Object aging allows applications to target garbage collection at a specific set of generations rather than requiring the garbage collector to evaluate all generations. Overloads of the <xref:System.GC.Collect%2A> method that include a `generation` parameter allow you to specify the oldest generation to be garbage collected.  
  
<a name="NoGCRegion"></a>   
## Disallowing garbage collection  
 Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/add/includes/net-v46-md.md)], the garbage collector supports a no GC region latency mode that can be used during the execution of critical paths in which garbage collection can adversely affect an app's performance. The no GC region latency mode requires that you specify an amount of memory that can be allocated without interference from the garbage collector. If the runtime can allocate that memory, the runtime will not perform a garbage collection while code in the critical path is executing.  
  
 You define the beginning of the critical path of the no GC region by calling one of the overloads of the <xref:System.GC.TryStartNoGCRegion%2A>. You specify the end of its critical path by calling the <xref:System.GC.EndNoGCRegion%2A> method.  
  
 You cannot nest calls to the <xref:System.GC.TryStartNoGCRegion%2A> method, and you should only call the <xref:System.GC.EndNoGCRegion%2A> method if the runtime is currently in no GC region latency mode. In other words, you should not call <xref:System.GC.TryStartNoGCRegion%2A> multiple times (after the first method call, subsequent calls will not succeed), and you should not expect calls to <xref:System.GC.EndNoGCRegion%2A> to succeed just because the first call to <xref:System.GC.TryStartNoGCRegion%2A> succeeded.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses several GC methods to get generation and memory information about a block of unused objects and print it to the console. The unused objects are then collected, and the resulting memory totals are displayed.

## Remarks  
 In determining when to schedule garbage collection, the runtime takes into account how much managed memory is allocated. If a small managed object allocates a large amount of unmanaged memory, the runtime takes into account only the managed memory, and thus underestimates the urgency of scheduling garbage collection. The AddMemoryPressure method informs the runtime of this additional pressure on system memory.  
  
 In the simplest usage pattern, a managed object allocates unmanaged memory in the constructor and releases it in the `Dispose` or `Finalize` method. Call the AddMemoryPressure method after allocating the unmanaged memory, and call the <xref:System.GC.RemoveMemoryPressure%2A> method after releasing it.  
  
 In more complicated scenarios, where the unmanaged memory allocation changes substantially during the lifetime of the managed object, you can call the AddMemoryPressure and <xref:System.GC.RemoveMemoryPressure%2A> methods to communicate these incremental changes to the runtime.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  You must ensure that you remove exactly the amount of pressure you add. Failing to do so can adversely affect the performance of the system in applications that run for long periods of time.

## Remarks  
 Use this method to try to reclaim all memory that is inaccessible. It performs a blocking garbage collection of all generations.  
  
 All objects, regardless of how long they have been in memory, are considered for collection; however, objects that are referenced in managed code are not collected. Use this method to force the system to try to reclaim the maximum amount of available memory.  
  
 Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v451](~/add/includes/net-v451-md.md)], you can compact the large object heap (LOH) by setting the <xref:System.Runtime.GCSettings.LargeObjectHeapCompactionMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to <xref:System.Runtime.GCLargeObjectHeapCompactionMode?displayProperty=fullName> before calling the Collect method, as the following example illustrates.

## Remarks  
 Use this method to try to reclaim memory that is inaccessible. However, using this method does not guarantee that all inaccessible memory in the specified generation is reclaimed.  
  
 If object aging is implemented, the garbage collector does not collect objects with a generation number that is higher than the specified generation. If object aging is not implemented, the garbage collector considers all objects during the garbage collection.  
  
 Use the <xref:System.GC.MaxGeneration%2A> property to determine the maximum valid value of the `generation` parameter.  
  
 To have the garbage collector consider all objects regardless of their generation, use the version of this method that takes no parameters. To have the garbage collector reclaim objects based on a <xref:System.GCCollectionMode> setting, use the <xref:System.GC.Collect%28System.Int32%2CSystem.GCCollectionMode%29?displayProperty=fullName> method overload.

## Remarks  
 Use the `mode` parameter to specify whether garbage collection should occur immediately or only if the time is optimal to reclaim objects. Using this method does not guarantee that all inaccessible memory in the specified generation is reclaimed.  
  
 To adjust the intrusiveness of garbage collection during critical periods in your application, set the <xref:System.Runtime.GCSettings.LatencyMode%2A> property.  
  
 The garbage collector does not collect objects with a generation number higher than specified by the `generation` parameter. Use the <xref:System.GC.MaxGeneration%2A> property to determine the maximum valid value of `generation`.  
  
 To have the garbage collector consider all objects regardless of their generation, use the version of this method that takes no parameters.  
  
 To have the garbage collector reclaim objects up to a specified generation of objects, use the <xref:System.GC.Collect%28System.Int32%29?displayProperty=fullName> method overload. When you specify the maximum generation, all objects are collected.

## Remarks  
 If you implement your own resource management, you might need to force garbage collection periodically by calling the <xref:System.GC.Collect%2A> method. Because this is an expensive operation, you can improve performance by skipping the call when a garbage collection has occurred recently. Save the value returned by CollectionCount immediately after calling <xref:System.GC.Collect%2A>. The next time you need to call <xref:System.GC.Collect%2A>, compare the current value returned by CollectionCount to the saved value. If the two values are equal, no collection has occurred in the interim and it is reasonable to call <xref:System.GC.Collect%2A> again.

## Remarks  
 Use this method to determine the age of an object, and then use that information with the <xref:System.GC.Collect%2A> method to force the garbage collector to collect objects in the same generation. For example, use this method when you have a set of objects that are created as a group and that become inaccessible at the same time.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates how to use the GetGeneration method to determine the age of an object. The example then performs garbage collections to clean up memory and compare the pre and post collection memory totals in the console.

## Remarks  
 If the `forceFullCollection` parameter is `true`, this method waits a short interval before returning while the system collects garbage and finalizes objects. The duration of the interval is an internally specified limit determined by the number of garbage collection cycles completed and the change in the amount of memory recovered between cycles. The garbage collector does not guarantee that all inaccessible memory is collected.

          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 The purpose of the KeepAlive method is to ensure the existence of a reference to an object that is at risk of being prematurely reclaimed by the garbage collector. A common scenario where this might happen is when there are no references to the object in managed code or data, but the object is still in use in unmanaged code such as Win32 APIs, unmanaged DLLs, or methods using COM.  
  
 This method references the `obj` parameter, making that object ineligible for garbage collection from the start of the routine to the point, in execution order, where this method is called. Code this method at the end, not the beginning, of the range of instructions where `obj` must be available.  
  
 The KeepAlive method performs no operation and produces no side effects other than extending the lifetime of the object passed in as a parameter.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example creates an object at the beginning of its `Main` method and does not refer to the object again until the end, when the KeepAlive method is called. The object persists for the 30-second duration of the `Main` method, despite calls to the <xref:System.GC.Collect%2A> and <xref:System.GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers%2A> methods.

## Remarks  
 The generation number, or age, of an object is an implementation-defined relative measure of an object's lifespan. The most recently created objects are in generation 0 and the oldest objects are in a generation less than or equal to the generation returned by the MaxGeneration property.  
  
 The garbage collector assumes that newer memory is more likely to be eligible for garbage collection than older memory. Therefore, the garbage collector improves its performance by adjusting generation numbers each time it reclaims memory, and the MaxGeneration property value can grow over time.  
  
 If object aging is implemented, the MaxGeneration property returns the maximum generation number used by the system; otherwise, this property returns zero.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates how to use the MaxGeneration property to display the largest generation number currently in use.

## Remarks  
 For each generation, the garbage collector sets a threshold for allocations into that generation. When the size of allocations exceeds this threshold, a garbage collection is triggered on that generation. For example, if generation 2’s threshold is 20MB (which means that 20MB survives generation 1 collections and is promoted into generation 2), and more than 20MB has survived generation 1 and is prompted into generation 2, the next garbage collection will be attempted as a generation 2 collection. Similarly, if the large object heap's (LOH's) threshold is 20MB and your app has allocated more than 20MB of large objects, the next garbage collection will also be attempted as a generation 2 collection (since the LOH is only collected in gen2 garbage collections).  
  
 The `maxGenerationThreshold` and `largeObjectHeapThreshold` thresholds control how much in advance you are notified before a full garbage collection occurs. The greater the threshold, the more allocations that can occur between notification and the next full garbage collection.  
  
 If you have situations in which a full garbage collection by the common language runtime would adversely affect your application's performance, you can ask to be notified when the runtime is about to do a full garbage collection and circumvent that collection by inducing a collection yourself (using the <xref:System.GC.Collect%2A> method) when conditions are still favorable. In addition to changing the garbage collection schedule yourself, full GC notification is useful in following the scenarios:  
  
-   You monitor for the approach of a full garbage collection and, when you are notified that one is approaching, you reduce live data size (for example, by releasing some cache entries). As a result, when the garbage collection occurs, it is able to reclaim more memory.  
  
-   You monitor for the completion of a full garbage collection so that you can collect some statistics.  For example, you might want to measure the size of the heap at GC completion so that you know the size of live data. (After a full GC, the heap is at its smallest size.)  
  
 For more information about what represents a full garbage collection, see [Garbage Collection Notifications](../Topic/Garbage%20Collection%20Notifications.md).  
  
 When you register for a garbage collection notification, you can be notified when a full garbage collection is approaching and when it is completed. This pattern resembles how the operating system monitors for low memory notifications.  
  
 Use the following guidelines for specifying the `maxGenerationThreshold` and `largeObjectHeapThreshold` parameters:  
  
-   The larger the threshold value, the more allocations will occur between the notification and the full garbage collection.  
  
     A larger threshold value provides more opportunities for the runtime to check for an approaching collection. This increases the likelihood that you will be notified. However, you should not set the threshold too high because that results in a more allocations before the runtime induces the next collection.  
  
     When you induce a collection yourself upon notification using a high threshold value, fewer objects are reclaimed than would be reclaimed by the runtime's next collection.  
  
-   The smaller the threshold value, the fewer the allocations between notification and the full garbage collection.

## Remarks  
 In determining when to schedule garbage collection, the runtime takes into account how much managed memory is allocated. If a small managed object allocates a large amount of unmanaged memory, the runtime takes into account only the managed memory, and thus underestimates the urgency of scheduling garbage collection. The <xref:System.GC.AddMemoryPressure%2A> method informs the runtime of this additional pressure on system memory, and the RemoveMemoryPressure method informs the runtime that the additional pressure has been released.  
  
 In the simplest usage pattern, a managed object allocates unmanaged memory in the constructor and releases it in the `Dispose` or `Finalize` method. Call the <xref:System.GC.AddMemoryPressure%2A> method after allocating the unmanaged memory, and call the RemoveMemoryPressure method after releasing it.  
  
 In more complicated scenarios, where the unmanaged memory allocation changes substantially during the lifetime of the managed object, you can call the <xref:System.GC.AddMemoryPressure%2A> and RemoveMemoryPressure methods to communicate these incremental changes to the runtime.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  You must ensure that you remove exactly the amount of pressure you add. Failing to do so can adversely affect the performance of the system in applications that run for long periods of time.

 By default, all objects that implement finalizers are added to the list of objects that require finalization; however, an object might have already been finalized or might have disabled finalization by calling the <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A> method.  
  
 A finalizer can use this method to resurrect itself or an object that it references.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates how to use the ReRegisterForFinalize method to finalize an object a second time after garbage collection.

## Remarks  
 This method sets a bit in the object header of `obj`, which the runtime checks when calling finalizers. A finalizer, which is represented by the <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method, is used to release unmanaged resources before an object is garbage-collected. If `obj` does not have a finalizer, the call to the SuppressFinalize method has no effect.  
  
 Objects that implement the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface can call this method from the object's <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=fullName> implementation to prevent the garbage collector from calling <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A?displayProperty=fullName> on an object that does not require it. Typically, this is done to prevent the finalizer from releasing unmanaged resources that have already been freed by the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=fullName> implementation.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates how to use the SuppressFinalize method in a resource class to prevent a redundant garbage collection from being called. The example uses the [dispose pattern](../Topic/Dispose%20Pattern.md) to free both managed resources (that is, objects that implement <xref:System.IDisposable>) and unmanaged resources.

## Remarks  
 Use the <xref:System.GCNotificationStatus> enumeration returned by this method to determine the status of the current garbage collection notification that was registered by using the <xref:System.GC.RegisterForFullGCNotification%2A> method. You can also use the <xref:System.GC.WaitForFullGCComplete%2A> method to determine whether the full garbage collection has completed.  
  
 When the enumeration returns <xref:System.GCNotificationStatus>, you can do tasks such as preventing additional objects from being allocated and inducing a collection yourself with the <xref:System.GC.Collect%2A> method. Note that the notification does not guarantee that a full garbage collection will occur, only that conditions have reached the threshold that are favorable for a full garbage collection to occur.  
  
 This method waits indefinitely for a garbage collection notification to be obtained. If you want to specify a time-out period for the method to return if the notification cannot be obtained, use the <xref:System.GC.WaitForFullGCApproach%28System.Int32%29?displayProperty=fullName> method overload. If you call this method without specifying a time-out, you can call the <xref:System.GC.CancelFullGCNotification%2A> method if you are waiting longer than preferred.  
  
 You should follow this method with a call to the <xref:System.GC.WaitForFullGCComplete%2A> method to make sure that you have had a full garbage collection. Calling this method alone causes indeterminate results.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows how to use this method to determine whether a full, blocking garbage collection is approaching. Whenever the status of the notification is <xref:System.GCNotificationStatus>, the user method `OnFullGCApproachNotify` is called to perform actions in response to the approaching collection. This code example is part of a larger example provided for [Garbage Collection Notifications](../Topic/Garbage%20Collection%20Notifications.md) topic.

        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 When the garbage collector finds objects that can be reclaimed, it checks each object to determine the object's finalization requirements. If an object implements a finalizer and has not disabled finalization by calling <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A>, the object is placed in a list of objects that are marked as ready for finalization. The garbage collector calls the <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A> methods for the objects in this list and removes the entries from the list. This method blocks until all finalizers have run to completion.  
  
 The thread on which finalizers are run is unspecified, so there is no guarantee that this method will terminate. However, this thread can be interrupted by another thread while the WaitForPendingFinalizers method is in progress. For example, you can start another thread that waits for a period of time and then interrupts this thread if this thread is still suspended.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates how to use the WaitForPendingFinalizers method to suspend the current thread until finalization of all the collected objects is complete.
